# 🧠 Elevate Labs Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of tree-based machine learning models using the Titanic dataset. The objective is to explore Decision Trees and Random Forests for classification, evaluate their performance, and interpret results.

---

## 📌 Task Objectives

1. **Train a Decision Tree Classifier** and visualize the decision boundaries.
2. **Analyze overfitting** and control tree depth to optimize performance.
3. **Train a Random Forest Classifier** and compare accuracy with the Decision Tree.
4. **Interpret feature importances** to understand model decisions.
5. **Evaluate models using cross-validation** for reliable performance metrics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Graphviz (for visualizing trees)
- Seaborn (for optional plots)
